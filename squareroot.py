# Purpose: script to use a function to calculate the square root of a positive floating point number

# look at the newton method at estimating square roots.
# Minute 17 of this vid has some ideas - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szQUIRPrAgQ

def sqrt():

#Sample Input
num = input("Enter a positive number: ")
# Do a check here to see if it is positive

#Define the function and input values
#Input Number, Number of iterations, Tolerence Level,
sqrt(num,num_of_iterations,tolerence_level)
    for x in range (num_of_iterations):
    #formula here...x= something
        if abs(x) is > tolerence_level:
            x = newx
        else
            print result
    
num_of_iterations = 100
tolerence_level = .001 

#Sample output
print(f"The square root of {num} is {newnum}")
