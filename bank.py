# Purpose: Receive two inputs, add them together and output the result

# There is a bit in this, break it down into smaller parts, 
# for example read in an integer first, (and print it back out again, 
# then do some arithmetic to it and print, then read in a second one and add the two, 
# and only then look at the formatting of the answer. of course there are many ways of doing this.

# input section 
# USE THIS FORMAT num1 = int(input("input Num1 "))
# NOTE to self - Add validations for number format - should be an INT and not CHAR etc
# Note to self - allow for negative values
# Note to self - after input, print value, convert to number with 2 decimal places, print it again as value in Euro
# Do Likewise with the second input

# calculations
