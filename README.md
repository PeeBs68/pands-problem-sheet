# 1. helloworld

Filename: helloworld.py (Task01)

Summary: Simple script which outputs **Hello World** to the terminal window. 

Details: The purpose of this script is to print the string "Hello World!".

# 2. bank

Filename: bank.py (Task02)

Summary: Script to input two integer values, add them together and output the result

Details: The purpose of this script is to prompt the user to input two values (in cents), add the two values together and output the result (in euros). The script is broken down into three sections
1) Input - prompt the user to input two values in cents. Validations are added during the input phase to verify the inputted numbers are integers and will prompt the user to retry otherwise. The inputted values are then displayed back to the user.
2) Calculations - in this section I add the two values together and divide by 100 to give a total in Euros (and Cents)
3) Output - the print command is used to output the result back to the terminal. The output is formatted to ensure that two decimal places are diaplayed.
